# Installation

## Pre-requisites

- [IMOD](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/)
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (tested with CUDA 10.1)
- [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html)

## Testing your installation

We recommend individually testing that each individual pre-requisite software
is installed correctly, before attempting to run Checkers.
The websites for each software should contain the most up-to-date
installation instructions, as well as how to test if your installation was successful.

## Installing Checkers

Assuming all the pre-requisites are correct, you can then run Checkers using the
main bash script (provided at [https://github.com/CryoSTEM-tools/Checkers/blob/main/Scripts/Checkers.sh](https://github.com/CryoSTEM-tools/Checkers/blob/main/Scripts/Checkers.sh)).

Our detailed user guide describes how to run each step of the process.
